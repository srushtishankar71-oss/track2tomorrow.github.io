                        <p class="team-bio">I am an aspiring sports journalist from Australia who's dream is to one day travel the world, doing what I love. I am a huge advocate for women in sports and believe everyone has a right to enjoy what they love. At the heart of everything I write, is a deep love for sport — and a belief that it should be a space where everyone feels seen, respected, and inspired. My mission is to tell powerful, passionate stories that go beyond the scoreboard. Whether it's covering the thrill of a race or the emotion of a game, I aim to shine a light on the people, moments, and messages that make sport so loveable.</p>

                        <p class="team-bio">I'm an aspiring engineer and journalist from California with a strong passion for using storytelling and innovation to create meaningful change. My dream is to impact youth and help provide opportunities that are often limited or inaccessible to many. I'm a strong advocate for inclusive sports for everyone, teen literacy, and mental health, and I believe these areas play a vital role in empowering the next generation. Through Track2Tomorrow, I work to combine my interests in motorsports, education, and community engagement to create spaces where young people feel supported, inspired, and able to pursue their potential.</p>
